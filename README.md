# Nuxt, Tailwind & NetlifyCMS

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/738be75f-f257-44d1-a8d2-0f26035c2702/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/shady-blog/deploys)

## Project commands

1. üì¶ Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. üèó Run the project for local dev. This will start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. üåå Build the app for server-side rendered deployment. See more about **Universal SSR** in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#server-rendered-universal-ssr-).

```bash
npm run build

# And to serve that deployment...
npm run start
```

4. ‚ö°Ô∏è Generate a fully pre-rendered static site. See more [in the docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#static-generated-pre-rendering-).

```bash
npm run generate
```

npm run build
npm run generate
npm run start

### Personalize setup

1. Copy and change the .env-file

   - `cp .env-example .env`
   - Then change the values

2. Change colors, favicon, content & content collections

   - Colors are managed in `assets/scss/_vars.scss` & `tailwind.config.js`
   - Favicon is generated by [@nuxt/pwa](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/). You should change the `static/icon.png` to something new, and then match the new filename and source in `nuxt.config.js` under `pwa.icon`. Replace the preview.jpg as well.
   - Content is managed mainly in [local Netlify CMS](http://localhost:3000/admin) by going to your `/admin`, in development mode by double-clicking on a post or by hand in `/content`
   - Content collections are managed in `static/admin/config.yml`

3. Change font

   1. Add/change your font link in `nuxt.config.js` under `head.link`. You can add a `<link rel="stylesheet" href="font.css">` as `link: [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: 'font.css' }]`, like [this](https://vue-meta.nuxtjs.org/api/#link)
   2. Then append your font name in `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.extend.fontFamily.sans` (or other).
   3. Then if you've uncommented the included netlify plugin "[Subfont](https://github.com/Munter/netlify-plugin-subfont#readme)" in `netlify.toml`, it will automatically post-processes your web page to use an optimal font loading strategy.
