## **How it Works**

Vue is designed to make the world easier. accordingly, much of the logic happens in the code itself. 

We can use the v-for directive to render a list of elements based on an array. Or in this case, based on an index. The special :key attribute is mainly used as a hint for Vue's virtual DOM algorithm to identify vnodes when comparing the new list of nodes against the old list.

```
<span v-for=" (menuItem, index) in menuItems":key="index">
```

```
<nuxt-Link :to="menuItem.Link">
```

 ist die syntax von nuxt und wird als <a> tag gerendert :to steht f√ºr href="".
