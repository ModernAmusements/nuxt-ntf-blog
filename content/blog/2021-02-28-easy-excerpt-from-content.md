title: Why I decided to redesign my website
description: The complete refresh of my website, which ended up changing the

**My website/portfolio was highly focused on projects I was doing as an employee or freelancer. While this highlights my skillset, nothing of my personality comes across. That's why I decided to completely rethink my portfolio. I questioned how the perfect portfolio of a developer should be structured. And went to the following results, which I would like to share with you.**

But still, you can only learn from something like this. no code is perfect and no developer is perfect. once you internalize that you can get better at what you do.
